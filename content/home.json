  "uferment-text": "U-Ferment is a service where you craft professional-grade wine, beer, or cider at a licensed facility. We provide the ingredients and equipment while handling the storage and technical monitoring of the fermentation process for you. It allows you to produce custom, high-quality beverages without the mess, space requirements, or daily maintenance of a home-brewing setup.",

  "howitworks-text": "You reserve a kit here or come into the store and pick from the inventory. You start the fermentation process with our assistance for your desired wine or wines (beer coming soon!) and we take it from there. We diligently tend to your batch, and we’ll let you know when it is ready to come and package. You can bring your own bottles or purchase from a variety of packaging options in store. Then you take home your beverage to drink or age as you please! ",
